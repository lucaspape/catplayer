General information:
IDE: Android Studio
Main programming language: Kotlin

How does the app retreive the monstercat data?

The app retreives the data the exact same way as the website. Monstercat has an API (connect.monstercat.com) wich returns JSON.
To view all URLs that the app uses please look into "res/values/api_strings.xml".

For almost all requests the library "Volley" is used.

How does the app perform a login?

The authentication data is stored inside a cookie which must be placed into the request header. This cookie can be retreived using a POST request to connect.monstercat.com/v2/signin
using the parameters "email" and "password" inside the JSON body.
The API server will return a cookie inside the header called "sid".
Please look into "java/de.lucaspape.monstercat.auth/Auth.kt"

All content data is retreived using ASYNC tasks. These can be found in "java/de.lucaspape.monstercat.handlers/".
These ASYNC tasks are started by the classes HomeHandler and PlaylistHandler (in the same package).

The UI is mainly controlled by the HomeFragment and PlaylistFragment (both of them create a new object of their Handler classes).

All song, album and playlist data is stored in SQLite databases and can be found in the "java/de.lucaspape.monstercat.database" package.

There are also some static files: MusicPlayer.kt, Auth.kt, HandlerUtils.kt and DownloadHandler.kt.
The functions of these files are called from multiple classes.
The MusicPlayer file controls the playback of the music and the notification.
DownloadHandler is mainly used as data storage, if the user wants to download a song it will be added to a list. This list is read by the AsyncTask DownloadTask which will download the files requested.
HandlerUtils has functions that are used by the HomeHandler and PlaylistHandler (no one wants duplicate functions).

The class JSONParser is mainly a file for nasty code which i dont want in my other classes.

The class settings is mainly a wrapper for Androids shared preferences for storing any strings.
